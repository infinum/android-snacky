# Android Snacky

Android library for enhancing the snackbar experience with Jetpack Compose. Snacky allows developers to create fully customizable snackbars without the limitations of the built-in options. Easily implement dynamic snackbars with various styles, actions, and behaviors tailored to your applicationâ€™s unique needs.

## Getting started

To include _Snacky_ in your project, you have to add buildscript dependencies in your project
level `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`:

**Groovy**

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

**KotlinDSL**

```kotlin
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

Then, you can include the library in your module's `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`:

**Groovy**

```groovy
implementation "com.infinum.snacky:snacky:0.1.0"
```

**KotlinDSL**

```kotlin
implementation("com.infinum.snacky:snacky:0.1.0")
```

Don't forget to sync your project.

### Usage
#### Displaying a Custom Snackbar

If you want to display a custom-looking snackbar with a specific duration, you first need to define a data model that holds the necessary information.
To create a snackbar with custom data, implement the `SnackyData` interface.`Render` function in the model should handle passing the necessary data to your custom snackbar composable (`PersonalMessageSnackbar`), ensuring it is properly configured with all required properties:

```kotlin
data class PersonalMessageSnackbarData(
    private val title: String,
    private val message: String,
    private val actionLabel: String,
    private val withDismissAction: Boolean,
    @DrawableRes val icon: Int,
    override val duration: SnackyDuration = SnackyDuration.Indefinite,
    override val onMainActionCallback: () -> Unit,
    override val onDismissCallback: () -> Unit,
) : SnackyData {
    @Composable
    override fun Render(snackbarState: SnackyState) {
        PersonalMessageSnackbar(
            title = title,
            message = message,
            icon = icon,
            actionLabel = actionLabel,
            withDismissAction = withDismissAction,
            dismiss = snackbarState::dismiss,
            performAction = snackbarState::performMainAction,
        )
    }
}
```

Then, to integrate the snackbar into your `Scaffold`:
* Provide a Snackbar Host: Use `SnackyHost` inside a Scaffold to manage snackbar display.
* Manage Snackbar State: Use `rememberSnackyHostState()` to control when the snackbar appears.
* Trigger the Snackbar: Launch a coroutine to show the snackbar when needed.

```kotlin
val snackbarHostState = rememberSnackyHostState()
val scope = rememberCoroutineScope()

Scaffold(
    snackbarHost = {
        SnackyHost(
            hostState = snackbarHostState,
            animationSpec = SnackyAnimationSpec(scaleFactor = 0.5f),
        )
    },
) { _ ->
    Box(
        modifier = Modifier
            .fillMaxSize(),
    ) {
        Button(
            onClick = {
                scope.launch {
                    snackbarHostState.showSnackbar(
                        PersonalMessageSnackbarData(
                            title = "Hi John,",
                            message = "Welcome to the world of Snacks! Explore the endless possibilities with delicious treats!",
                            actionLabel = "Explore",
                            duration = SnackyDuration.Custom(6.seconds),
                            icon = android.R.drawable.ic_dialog_info,
                            withDismissAction = true,
                            onDismissCallback = { },
                            onMainActionCallback = { 
                                // navigate to the next screen
                            },
                        ),
                    )
                }
            }
        ) {
            Text(
                text = "Show snackbar",
                textAlign = TextAlign.Center,
            )
        }
    }
}
```

With this setup, you can now display multiple customized snackbars on the same screen using a single `SnackyHost`. This means different types of snackbars - each with unique styles, actions, duration and content - can seamlessly coexist in your app.

Additionally, `SnackyHost` supports animation customization through `animationSpec`, allowing you to fine-tune:

* Fade in/out duration
* In between delay
* Scale factor
* Scale easing
* Opacity easing

#### Displaying a Default Snackbar

And if you ever need a default - looking snackbar, you can simply call:

```kotlin
scope.launch {
    snackbarHostState.showSnackbar(
        message = "Some info message",
    )
}
```
